# HJ-Hardcopy-Manager

Locally hosted Flask application to assist customer service representatives with working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. This enables the ability to take bulk order PDFs from Oracle and separate them into individual orders, renamed and sorted by the contents of each order.  

Once split into individual files, each page is parsed for the item numbers and state and then renamed for easy searching.
